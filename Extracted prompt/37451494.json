    "Description": "Entity extraction is performed using ScispaCy and medspaCy libraries. Disease and drug mentions are detected using spaCyâ€™s NER models trained on biomedical corpora (bc5cdr). Negation detection is handled using the ConText algorithm to determine if entities are affirmative or negated. Entities are categorized into current, past, and family history using rule-based section classification.",

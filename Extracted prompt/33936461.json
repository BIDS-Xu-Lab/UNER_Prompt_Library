    "Description": "Each EHR was annotated using a BIO tagging scheme for six bleeding-related entities. Annotators used contextual cues (negation, causality) and included multi-word spans when needed. The guidelines emphasized identifying exact mentions within Â±2 lines of known bleeding indicators.",

    "Name": "TUCP EF Year 3 Corpus",
    "Description": "A collection of 3060 VA clinical reports (Echocardiography, Radiology, TIU), with 1465 annotated for LVEF information using a standardized schema. The corpus was used to train and evaluate new sequence-tagging models."

  "AnnotationGuidelines": {
    "Description": "Clinical notes were annotated using a BIO-tag format. Concepts were annotated by two independent reviewers and adjudicated by a domain expert. Special attention was paid to ensure consistent term boundary definitions across corpora. Distinctions between LVEF and LVSF mentions were emphasized in the TUCP EF Year 3 schema.",

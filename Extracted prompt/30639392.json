    "Description": "Annotations were performed using both a rule-based NLP system (regular expressions + negation detection) and NimbleMiner (word embedding-based term discovery with human-in-the-loop). Simclins (similar clinical terms) were iteratively reviewed and refined for labeling using positive-only label learning. Negation terms were excluded using the NegEx algorithm.",
